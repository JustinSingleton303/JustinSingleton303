### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Justin. ðŸ‘‹
I am a recent graduate of the Metropolitan State Unviversity of Denver, where I majored in theoretical mathematics and minored in CS.
I would love to go to grad school for mathematics and get a PhD in analysis or topology, but having a wife and now a son has brought me back
to my first love, Computer Science!
