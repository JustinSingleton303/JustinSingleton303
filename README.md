### 👋 Hi there, my name is Justin. 👋
I am a recent graduate of the Metropolitan State Unviversity of Denver, where I majored in theoretical mathematics and minored in CS.
I would love to go to grad school for mathematics and get a PhD in analysis or topology, but the needs that come along with having a wife 
and son has brought me back to my first love, Computer Science!
